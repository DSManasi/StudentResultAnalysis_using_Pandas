📊 Student Result Analysis using Pandas
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing student performance data using Python and Pandas. The goal is to understand how various factors such as gender, parental education, marital status, ethnic group, and study hours affect students’ academic scores. Data visualization is used to clearly present insights and patterns.
